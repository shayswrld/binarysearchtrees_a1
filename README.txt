## Introduction
This Java program is a simplified version of TikTok, a popular social media platform, implemented using binary search trees (BSTs) as the underlying data structure. It provides basic functionality for users to create and view posts, follow other users, and interact with content.

## Features
- Creating an account
- Deleting an account
- Searching for an account
- Reading a textfile of commands into the binary search tree (that is creating users, adding posts, removing posts, displaying accounts)
- Follow and remove followers
- Displaying an account that is searched for by a user

## Contributors
The implementation of a binary search tree in java was provided by Hussein Suleiman at the University of Cape Town.
The implementation uses generics which allow the tree to store Object types.

## Note:
This was an assignment issued as part of the CSC2001F course at the University of Cape Town
